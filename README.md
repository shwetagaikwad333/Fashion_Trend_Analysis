# Fashion_Trend_Analysis
## Problem Statement
The fashion retail industry is dynamic, with brands competing on style, pricing, and
discounts. Reliance Trends caters to men, women, and kids with a wide variety of
categories and products. However, customer decisions are influenced by factors such
as price, discount percentage, brand, and product category. To stay competitive, it is
important to understand fashion trends, discount strategies, and product preferences.

1. Identify which product categories and brands attract the most customers.
2. Evaluate the impact of discounts on customer buying behavior.
3. Understand gender-based and category-based preferences.
4. Explore the effectiveness of different price segments (Budget, Mid, Premium,
Luxury).
5. Provide insights for optimizing product pricing and discount strategies.
